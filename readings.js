        '01-01': { source: '"They did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year." - Joshua 5:12', text: 'Israel\'s weary wanderings were all over, and the promised rest was attained. No more moving tents, fiery serpents, fierce Amalekites, and howling wildernesses: they came to the land which flowed with milk and honey, and they ate the old corn of the land. Perhaps this year, beloved Christian reader, this may be thy case or mine. Joyful is the prospect, and if faith be in active exercise, it will yield unalloyed delight. To be with Jesus in the rest which remaineth for the people of God, is a cheering hope indeed, and to expect this glory so soon is a double bliss. Unbelief shudders at the Jordan which still rolls between us and the goodly land, but let us rest assured that we have already experienced more ills than death at its worst can cause us. Let us banish every fearful thought, and rejoice with exceeding great joy, in the prospect that this year we shall begin to be "for ever with the Lord." A part of the host will this year tarry on earth, to do service for their Lord. If this should fall to our lot, there is no reason why the New Year\'s text should not still be true. "We who have believed do enter into rest." The Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance; He gives us "glory begun below." In heaven they are secure, and so are we preserved in Christ Jesus; there they triumph over their enemies, and we have victories too. Celestial spirits enjoy communion with their Lord, and this is not denied to us; they rest in His love, and we have perfect peace in Him: they hymn His praise, and it is our privilege to bless Him too. We will this year gather celestial fruits on earthly ground, where faith and hope have made the desert like the garden of the Lord. Man did eat angels\' food of old, and why not now ? O for grace to feed on Jesus, and so to eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan this year!' },
        '01-02': { source: '"Continue in prayer." - Colossians 4:2', text: 'It is interesting to remark how large a portion of Sacred Writ is occupied with the subject of prayer, either in furnishing examples, enforcing precepts, or pronouncing promises. We scarcely open the Bible before we read, "Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord;" and just as we are about to close the volume, the "Amen" of an earnest supplication meets our ear. Instances are plentiful. Here we find a wrestling Jacob--there a Daniel who prayed three times a day--and a David who with all his heart called upon his God. On the mountain we see Elias; in the dungeon Paul and Silas. We have multitudes of commands, and myriads of promises. What does this teach us, but the sacred importance and necessity of prayer? We may be certain that whatever God has made prominent in His Word, He intended to be conspicuous in our lives. If He has said much about prayer, it is because He knows we have much need of it. So deep are our necessities, that until we are in heaven we must not cease to pray. Dost thou want nothing? Then, I fear thou dost not know thy poverty. Hast thou no mercy to ask of God?  Then, may the Lord\'s mercy show thee thy misery! A prayerless soul is a Christless soul. Prayer is the lisping of the believing infant, the shout of the fighting believer, the requiem of the dying saint falling asleep in Jesus. It is the breath, the watchword, the comfort, the strength, the honour of a Christian. If thou be a child of God, thou wilt seek thy Father\'s face, and live in thy Father\'s love. Pray that this year thou mayst be holy, humble, zealous, and patient; have closer communion with Christ, and enter oftener into the banqueting-house of His love. Pray that thou mayst be an example and a blessing unto others, and that thou mayst live more to the glory of thy Master. The motto for this year must be, "Continue in prayer."' },
        '01-03': { source: '"I have given Him for a covenant of the people." - Isaiah 49:8', text: 'Jesus Christ is Himself the sum and substance of the covenant, and as one of its gifts, He is the property of every believer. Believer, canst thou estimate what thou hast gotten in Christ? "In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." Consider that word "God" and its infinity, and then meditate upon "perfect man" and all his beauty; for all that Christ, as God and man, ever had, or can have, is thine--out of pure free favour, passed over to thee to be thine entailed property forever. Our blessed Jesus, as God, is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. Will it not console you to know that all these great and glorious attributes are altogether yours?  Has he power? That power is yours to support and strengthen you, to overcome your enemies, and to preserve you even to the end. Has He love? Well, there is not a drop of love in His heart which is not yours; you may dive into the immense ocean of His love, and you may say of it all, "It is mine." Hath He justice? It may seem a stern attribute, but even that is yours, for He will by His justice see to it that all which is promised to you in the covenant of grace shall be most certainly secured to you. And all that He has as perfect man is yours. As a perfect man the Father\'s delight was upon Him. He stood accepted by the Most High. O believer, God\'s acceptance of Christ is thine acceptance; for knowest thou not that the love which the Father set on a perfect Christ, He sets on thee now? For all that Christ did is thine. That perfect righteousness which Jesus wrought out, when through His stainless life He kept the law and made it honourable, is thine, and is imputed to thee. Christ is in the covenant.' },
        '01-04': { source: '"Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." - 2 Peter 3:18', text: '"Grow in grace"--not in one grace only, but in all grace. Grow in that root-grace, faith. Believe the promises more firmly than you have done. Let faith increase in fulness, constancy, simplicity. Grow also in love. Ask that your love may become extended, more intense, more practical, influencing every thought, word, and deed. Grow likewise in humility. Seek to lie very low, and know more of your own nothingness. As you grow downward in humility, seek also to grow upward--having nearer approaches to God in prayer and more intimate fellowship with Jesus. May God the Holy Spirit enable you to "grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour." He who grows not in the knowledge of Jesus, refuses to be blessed. To know Him is "life eternal," and to advance in the knowledge of Him is to increase in happiness. He who does not long to know more of Christ, knows nothing of Him yet. Whoever hath sipped this wine will thirst for more, for although Christ doth satisfy, yet it is such a satisfaction, that the appetite is not cloyed, but whetted. If you know the love of Jesus--as the hart panteth for the water-brooks, so will you pant after deeper draughts of His love. If you do not desire to know Him better, then you love Him not, for love always cries, "Nearer, nearer." Absence from Christ is hell; but the presence of Jesus is heaven. Rest not then content without an increasing acquaintance with Jesus. Seek to know more of Him in His divine nature, in His human relationship, in His finished work, in His death, in His resurrection, in His present glorious intercession, and in His future royal advent. Abide hard by the Cross, and search the mystery of His wounds. An increase of love to Jesus, and a more perfect apprehension of His love to us is one of the best tests of growth in grace.' },
        '01-05': { source: '"God divided the light from the darkness." - Genesis 1:4', text: 'Light might well be good since it sprang from that fiat of goodness, "Let there be light." We who enjoy it should be more grateful for it than we are, and see more of God in it and by it. Light physical is said by Solomon to be sweet, but gospel light is infinitely more precious, for it reveals eternal things, and ministers to our immortal natures. When the Holy Spirit gives us spiritual light, and opens our eyes to behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, we behold sin in its true colours, and ourselves in our real position; we see the Most Holy God as He reveals Himself, the plan of mercy as He propounds it, and the world to come as the Word describes it. Spiritual light has many beams and prismatic colours, but whether they be knowledge, joy, holiness, or life, all are divinely good. If the light received be thus good, what must the essential light be, and how glorious must be the place where He reveals Himself. O Lord, since light is so good, give us more of it, and more of Thyself, the true light.\n\nNo sooner is there a good thing in the world, than a division is necessary. Light and darkness have no communion; God has divided them, let us not confound them. Sons of light must not have fellowship with deeds, doctrines, or deceits of darkness. The children of the day must be sober, honest, and bold in their Lord\'s work, leaving the works of darkness to those who shall dwell in it for ever. Our Churches should by discipline divide the light from the darkness, and we should by our distinct separation from the world do the same. In judgment, in action, in hearing, in teaching, in association, we must discern between the precious and the vile, and maintain the great distinction which the Lord made upon the world\'s first day. O Lord Jesus, be Thou our light throughout the whole of this day, for Thy light is the light of men.' },
        '02-01': { source: '"The porter opened to him." - John 10:3', text: 'Jesus is the door of the sheepfold. Entrance into the Church is through Him, and through Him only. And again, He is the door of the sheep. "By me if any man enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture." But we have another porter besides Jesus. The Holy Spirit is the porter of the house of God. Jesus is the door, but the Holy Spirit is the porter who opens the door and admits the chosen people. How is it that the porter opens the door to any? On what ground does He admit them? Does He open it to them on account of their own merits and deserving? By no means. The porter of the house of mercy opens the door to those who knock, but the knocker is in the suppliant\'s hand; he has nothing to do but to knock, and the porter opens. The porter is not the master of the house; he has his Lord\'s orders. He is the servant of Jesus Christ, and he has his orders what to do. What is the order to the sacred porter? It is this, "To him that knocketh it shall be opened." If you come, my dear friend, to the door of grace, you have nothing whatever to bring as a recommendation. You must come as a sinner, with the rope about your neck, and as a beggar, you must come and knock, and the porter has his orders to open to you. There is a free admission to all who are sinners. If you have a sense of your sinfulness, you are bidden to come, and the porter will open to you. If you have no good thing of your own to recommend you, so much the better; you are all the more fit to come. He who has broken God\'s law, and who confesses it; he who has no righteousness of his own, and is willing to take Christ\'s righteousness; he who has no strength, but is willing to be made strong in the Lord, is bidden to come and knock, and the porter will open to him. The porter\'s name is "the Spirit of all grace," and he will open to every seeking sinner.' },
        '02-02': { source: '"What think ye of Christ?" - Matthew 22:42', text: 'The great test of your soul\'s health is, "What think ye of Christ?" There are some who think nothing of Christ, and they are in a state of condemnation. There are others who think a little of Christ; they think of Him as a good man, a great prophet, an admirable example; but they will not receive Him as their God, and they have not His life within them. But what think ye of Christ, O believer? Is He to you the chief among ten thousand, and the altogether lovely? Is He the very center of your soul\'s delight? Do you have high and adoring thoughts of Him? Do you think of Him as your Lord and your God? Can you say with Thomas, "My Lord and my God"? Then you have the right thoughts of Christ. But there is another question, "What does Christ think of you?" You may soon answer that. If you have high thoughts of Him, He has high thoughts of you. If you think Him a bare man, He will think you a bare man. If you think Him a prophet, He will think you a sinner. But if you think Him to be your God, He will think you to be one of His children. If you call Him your all, He will call you His treasure. If you have high thoughts of Christ, He will have high thoughts of you. He will say, "You are my brother, you are my sister, you are my spouse." He will say, "You are a member of my body, of my flesh, and of my bones." He will say, "You are my treasure, my jewels, my portion." He will say, "You are my love, my dove, my undefiled." Let the two questions go together. "What think ye of Christ?" and "What does Christ think of you?" and you will find that as your heart is towards Christ, so is Christ\'s heart towards you. If you are cold towards Him, He cannot be warm towards you. If you have little love to Him, you can have but little of His love shed abroad in your heart. Let us have high thoughts of Christ, and Christ will have high thoughts of us.' },

Not in the sense in which I have anything of my own, but in a higher, a better, and a more spiritual sense. Christ is mine by the free gift of His Father. "He hath given Him to be the head over all things to the Church." Christ is mine by His own purchase. He has bought me with His precious blood. Christ is mine by my own choice. I have chosen Him to be my Lord, my Saviour, my all. And Christ is mine by my own reception of Him. I have taken Him to be my own. I have laid hold on Him by faith. O my soul, is this a truth? Is Jesus thine? Is He thy Saviour? Is He thy God? Then here is a sweet thought for thee. Christ is thine, and all that He has is thine. His wisdom is thine to teach thee. His power is thine to uphold thee. His love is thine to comfort thee. His righteousness is thine to justify thee. His blood is thine to cleanse thee. His heaven is thine to receive thee. And what is more, "I am His." I am His by His Father\'s gift. I am His by His own purchase. I am His by my own surrender of myself to Him. I am His by His Spirit\'s work in me. I am His, and He will keep me. I am His, and He will use me. I am His, and He will glorify me. O what a blessed portion is this! "My beloved is mine, and I am His." It is a mutual possession. It is a sweet exchange. It is a blessed communion. It is a glorious union. It is a source of unspeakable joy. O my soul, live in the constant enjoyment of this precious truth. Let it be thy song in the house of thy pilgrimage. Let it be thy comfort in the hour of trial. Let it be thy strength in the day of conflict. Let it be thy hope in the prospect of death.

You will be set at liberty, and that liberty will be eternal. And what is it that gives you this hope? It is "the blood of the covenant." It is not your own merit, not your own works, not your own feelings, but the blood of the covenant. That blood is the foundation of your hope. That blood is the price of your redemption. That blood is the seal of your pardon. That blood is the pledge of your inheritance. That blood is the life of your soul. O my soul, look to the blood of the covenant this day. Look to it as the antidote to all your fears. Look to it as the source of all your joys. Look to it as the ground of all your confidence. Look to it as the spring of all your holiness. Look to it as the earnest of all your glory. The blood of the covenant is a precious theme. It is a theme for which we ought to be very thankful. It is a theme upon which we ought to dwell with delight. It is a theme which ought to fill our hearts with love, and our lips with praise. O for grace to understand, to appreciate, and to apply this precious truth, "the blood of the covenant."' },

If thou canst pour this promise into thy cup, wilt thou not say with David, "My cup runneth over; I have more than heart can wish"? When this is fulfilled, "I am thy God," art thou not possessor of all things? Desire is insatiable as death, but he who hath God hath all things. God is the summit of the believer\'s happiness. He is the fountain of all his joys. He is the life of his soul. He is the light of his eyes. He is the strength of his heart. He is the portion of his inheritance. He is his all in all. O my soul, what more canst thou desire? What more canst thou have? "I will be their God." Here is a promise which is as broad as the wants of man, as deep as the corruptions of his heart, as high as the aspirations of his soul. Here is a promise which is a panacea for all his diseases, a balm for all his wounds, a cordial for all his fears. Here is a promise which is a staff to support him in all his weakness, a shield to protect him in all his dangers, a sword to defend him in all his conflicts. Here is a promise which is a sun to enlighten him in all his darkness, a star to guide him in all his perplexities, a rock to shelter him in all his storms. Here is a promise which is a treasure to enrich him in all his poverty, a home to receive him in all his wanderings, a heaven to crown him in all his toils. "I am thy God." O my soul, lay hold on this promise. Plead it before the throne of grace. Live upon it in thy daily walk. Die with it upon thy lips. And in heaven thou shalt sing of it for ever and ever.' },

O what a comfort it is to know that we are not left to our own guidance, but that we have a guide who is infallible, a guide who is all-wise, a guide who is all-powerful, a guide who is all-gracious. Believer, look up to thy guide. Trust in Him at all times. Follow Him whithersoever He goeth. He will lead thee by a right way to a city of habitation. He will bring thee safely to thy journey\'s end. He will present thee faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy. O what a blessed prospect!

There must be _life_--a vital principle infused into us by God the Holy Ghost, or we cannot be trees of the Lord. The mere name of being a Christian is but a dead thing, we must be filled with the spirit of divine life. This life is _mysterious_. We do not understand the circulation of the sap, by what force it rises, and by what power it descends again. So the life within us is a sacred mystery. Regeneration is wrought by the Holy Ghost entering into man and becoming man\'s life; and this divine life in a believer afterwards feeds upon the flesh and blood of Christ and is thus sustained by divine food, but whence it cometh and whither it goeth who shall explain to us? What a _secret_ thing the sap is! The roots go searching through the soil with their little spongioles, but we cannot see them suck out the various gases, or transmute the mineral into the vegetable; this work is done down in the dark. Our root is Christ Jesus, and our life is hid in Him; this is the secret of the Lord. The radix of the Christian life is as secret as the life itself. How _permanently active_ is the sap in the cedar! In the Christian the divine life is always full of energy--not always in fruit-bearing, but in inward operations. The believer\'s _graces_, are not every one of them in constant motion? but his life never ceases to palpitate within. He is not always working for God, but his heart is always living upon Him. As the sap _manifests itself in producing the foliage and fruit of the tree_, so with a truly healthy Christian, his grace is externally manifested in his walk and conversation. If you talk with him, he cannot help speaking about Jesus. If you notice his actions you will see that he has been with Jesus. He has so much sap within, that it must fill his conduct and conversation with life.' },

He is mighty to bless. He is mighty to do for them exceeding abundantly above all that they can ask or think. O what a comfort it is to know that the Lord is in the midst of us, and that He is mighty! Let us then not be afraid of our enemies. Let us not be discouraged by our difficulties. Let us not be cast down by our trials. Let us trust in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.' },

He will save. He will save from sin, from sorrow, from death, from hell. He will rejoice over thee with joy. He will delight in thee as His own portion, His own inheritance, His own bride. He will rest in His love. He will never change in His affection towards thee. He will joy over thee with singing. He will express His love to thee in songs of joy. O what a blessed portion is this for the believer! To be saved by the Lord, to be the object of His joy, to be the subject of His song. Let us then rejoice in the Lord always. Let us praise Him for His wonderful love to us. Let us live to His glory. And let us long for the day when we shall see Him as He is, and be for ever with Him.' },
        '10-01': { source: '"Pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved." - Song of Solomon 7:13', text: 'The spouse desires to give to Jesus all that she produces. Our heart has "all manner of pleasant fruits," both "old and new," and they are laid up for our Beloved. At this rich autumnal season of fruit, let us survey our stores. We have _new_ fruits. We desire to feel new life, new joy, new gratitude; we wish to make new resolves and carry them out by new labours; our heart blossoms with new prayers, and our soul is pledging herself to new efforts. But we have some _old_ fruits too. There is our first love: a choice fruit that! and Jesus delights in it. There is our first faith: that simple faith by which, having nothing, we became possessors of all things. There is our joy when first we knew the Lord: let us revive it. We have our old remembrances of the promises. How faithful has God been! In sickness, how softly did He make our bed! In deep waters, how placidly did He buoy us up! In the flaming furnace, how graciously did He deliver us. Old fruits, indeed! We have many of them, for His mercies have been more than the hairs of our head. Old sins we must regret, but then we have had repentances which He has given us, by which we have wept our way to the cross, and learned the merit of His blood. We have fruits, this morning, both new and old; but here is the point--_they are all laid up for Jesus_. Truly, those are the best and most acceptable services in which Jesus is the solitary aim of the soul, and His glory, without any admixture whatever, the end of all our efforts. Let our many fruits be laid up only for our Beloved; let us display them when He is with us, and not hold them up before the gaze of men. Jesus, we will turn the key in our garden door, and none shall enter to rob Thee of one good fruit from the soil which Thou hast watered with Thy bloody sweat. Our all shall be Thine, Thine only, O Jesus, our Beloved!' },
        '11-01': { source: '"The Church in thy house." - Philemon 2', text: 'Is there a Church in this house? Are parents, children, friends, servants, all members of it? or are some still unconverted? Let us pause here and let the question go round--_Am I a member of the Church in this house_? How would father\'s heart leap for joy, and mother\'s eyes fill with holy tears if from the eldest to the youngest all were saved! Let us pray for this great mercy until the Lord shall grant it to us. Probably it had been the dearest object of Philemon\'s desires to have all his household saved; but it was not at first granted him in its fulness. He had a wicked servant, Onesimus, who, having wronged him, ran away from his service. His master\'s prayers followed him, and at last, as God would have it, Onesimus was led to hear Paul preach; his heart was touched, and he returned to Philemon, not only to be a faithful servant, but a brother beloved, adding another member to the Church in Philemon\'s house. Is there an unconverted servant or child absent this morning? Make special supplication that such may, on their return to their home, gladden all hearts with good news of what grace has done! Is there one present? Let him partake in the same earnest entreaty.\n\nIf there be such a Church in our house, let us order it well, and let all act as in the sight of God. Let us move in the common affairs of life with studied holiness, diligence, kindness, and integrity. More is expected of a Church than of an ordinary household; family worship must, in such a case, be more devout and hearty; internal love must be more warm and unbroken, and external conduct must be more sanctified and Christlike. We need not fear that the smallness of our number will put us out of the list of Churches, for the Holy Spirit has here enrolled a family-church in the inspired book of remembrance. As a Church let us now draw nigh to the great head of the one Church universal, and let us beseech Him to give us grace to shine before men to the glory of His name.' },
        '12-01': { source: '"Thou hast made summer and winter." - Psalm 74:17', text: 'My soul begin this wintry month with thy God. The cold snows and the piercing winds all remind thee that He keeps His covenant with day and night, and tend to assure thee that He will also keep that glorious covenant which He has made with thee in the person of Christ Jesus. He who is true to His Word in the revolutions of the seasons of this poor sin-polluted world, will not prove unfaithful in His dealings with His own well-beloved Son.\n\nWinter in the soul is by no means a comfortable season, and if it be upon thee just now it will be very painful to thee: but there is this comfort, namely, that _the Lord_ makes it. He sends the sharp blasts of adversity to nip the buds of expectation: He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes over the once verdant meadows of our joy: He casteth forth His ice like morsels freezing the streams of our delight. He does it all, He is the great Winter King, and rules in the realms of frost, and therefore thou canst not murmur. Losses, crosses, heaviness, sickness, poverty, and a thousand other ills, are of the Lord\'s sending, and come to us with wise design. Frosts kill noxious insects, and put a bound to raging diseases; they break up the clods, and sweeten the soul. O that such good results would always follow our winters of affliction!\n\nHow we prize the fire just now! how pleasant is its cheerful glow! Let us in the same manner prize our Lord, who is the constant source of warmth and comfort in every time of trouble. Let us draw nigh to Him, and in Him find joy and peace in believing. Let us wrap ourselves in the warm garments of His promises, and go forth to labours which befit the season, for it were ill to be as the sluggard who will not plough by reason of the cold; for he shall beg in summer and have nothing.' }
